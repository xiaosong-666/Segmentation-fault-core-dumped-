https://pypi.org/project/pip-utils/ reads:

By default, pip-utils will interact with packages installed to the user site (assuming the user site is available). To disable this behavior, call pip-utils with Pythonâ€™s -s option (i.e. python -sm pip_utils) or PYTHONNOUSERSITE environment variable (i.e. PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 python -m pip_utils).
