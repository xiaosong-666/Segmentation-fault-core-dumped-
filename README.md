# Segmentation-fault-core-dumped-
try to run python but got the error: Segmentation fault (core dumped)

the main reason is that you have installed many things in your home version python, try to keep your ~/.local/lib/python*/site-packages clean: python -sm pip or export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1
otherwise when you will use the libraries from home instead of conda_env even though you run your software in the build conda env, which will cause conflicts and so on...(mess/chiaos)

the way to solve this is put PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 python xxx.py -h to aviod the library or anything from your home

normarlly, the reason you have many things  ~/.local/lib/python*/site-packages is that you use pip install packages 

https://pypi.org/project/pip-utils/ reads:

By default, pip-utils will interact with packages installed to the user site (assuming the user site is available). To disable this behavior, call pip-utils with Pythonâ€™s -s option (i.e. python -sm pip_utils) or PYTHONNOUSERSITE environment variable (i.e. PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 python -m pip_utils).
